# GTFO

## Description 
Tired of being stuck in one city for over a year? Then you're in the right place!

This application is for letting the user plan a trip by emtering where they would like to go, their own interests and the activities they enjoy doing, and a budget to maximize their trip time without breaking the bank!

Plan your next trip at the link below to get away, give your pets a break from you for a little bit, or just plain relax and enjoy some of the things life has to offer.
